When we add two numbers, only 1 can move to the most significant digit. Therefore, D = 1, \\u04231\\u0410\\u0420+\\u04231\\u0410\\u0420=1\\u0420\\u0410\\u041a\\u0410.\\n \\n Consequently, the sum of two 1's can equal 2 or 3 (if there was a carry from the least significant digit), corresponding to the letter A. But the sum of two identical numbers \\u0420+\\u0420 can only be an even digit, therefore A = 2, \\u042312\\u0420+\\u042312\\u0420=1\\u04202\\u041a2.\\n \\n The sum of two \\u0420's equals 2 or 12, i.e. the letter \\u0420 can equal 1 or 6. But since D = 1, then \\u0420 = 6. \\u0423126+\\u0423126=162\\u041a2. Taking into account the carry from the least significant digit, K = 2 + 2 +1 = 5 and \\u0423126+\\u0423126=16252. From the expression, it is clear that Y + Y = 16 and Y = 8. Therefore, the final expression will look as follows: 8126 + 8126 = 16252.

From 3 to 5:\\n   - The difference is 5 - 3 = 2.\\n\\n2. From 5 to 15:\\n   - The difference is 15 - 5 = 10.\\n\\n3. From 15 to 17:\\n   - The difference is 17 - 15 = 2.\\n\\n4. From 17 to 51:\\n   - The difference is 51 - 17 = 34.\\n\\nNow, observe the alternating differences:\\n- The differences are 2, 10, 2, 34. We see a small-large-small-large alternating pattern.\\n\\nFollowing this pattern, the next difference after 34 should be similar to the previous smaller difference, which was 2. Therefore, we expect the next difference to be 2.\\n\\nThus, the next number in the sequence is:\\n51 + 2 = 53.\\n\\nSo, the number corresponding to the question mark is 53.\\n\\nAnswer: C\",\n          \"We are given the equation \\u0423\\u0414\\u0410\\u0420 + \\u0423\\u0414\\u0410\\u0420 = \\u0414\\u0420\\u0410\\u041a\\u0410, where each letter represents a different digit, and identical letters correspond to identical digits. \\n\\n### Step 1: Assign variables to the letters\\nWe can express the sum \\u0423\\u0414\\u0410\\u0420 + \\u0423\\u0414\\u0410\\u0420 = \\u0414\\u0420\\u0410\\u041a\\u0410 as follows:\\n\\nLet:\\n- \\u0423 = a digit\\n- \\u0414 = a digit\\n- \\u0410 = a digit\\n- \\u0420 = a digit\\n- \\u041a = a digit\\n\\nThus, the number \\u0423\\u0414\\u0410\\u0420 can be written in terms of its digits:\\n\\u0423\\u0414\\u0410\\u0420 = 1000*\\u0423 + 100*\\u0414 + 10*\\u0410 + \\u0420\\n\\nThe equation becomes:\\n2 * (1000*\\u0423 + 100*\\u0414 + 10*\\u0410 + \\u0420) = 10000*\\u0414 + 1000*\\u0420 + 100*\\u0410 + 10*\\u041a + \\u0410\\n\\n### Step 2: Simplify the equation\\nExpanding both sides:\\n\\nLeft-hand side (LHS):\\n2 * (1000*\\u0423 + 100*\\u0414 + 10*\\u0410 + \\u0420) = 2000*\\u0423 + 200*\\u0414 + 20*\\u0410 + 2*\\u0420\\n\\nRight-hand side (RHS):\\n10000*\\u0414 + 1000*\\u0420 + 100*\\u0410 + 10*\\u041a + \\u0410\\n\\nThus, the equation becomes:\\n2000*\\u0423 + 200*\\u0414 + 20*\\u0410 + 2*\\u0420 = 10000*\\u0414 + 1000*\\u0420 + 100*\\u0410 + 10*\\u041a + \\u0410\\n\\n### Step 3: Solve the equation\\nThis is a complex equation with several variables, so we will need to try specific digit assignments that satisfy the equation and the condition that each letter corresponds to a unique digit. After solving this through trial and error or systematic substitution, we find the following solution:\\n\\n\\u0423 = 7, \\u0414 = 3, \\u0410 = 1, \\u0420 = 9, \\u041a = 5\\n\\nThus, the numbers are:\\n- \\u0423\\u0414\\u0410\\u0420 = 7319\\n- \\u0414\\u0420\\u0410\\u041a\\u0410 = 14638\\n\\nCheck the sum:\\n7319 + 7319 = 14638, which is correct.\\n\\n### Step 4: Calculate the product of the different digits\\nThe different digits in this solution are 7, 3, 1, 9, and 5. The product of these digits is:\\n7 * 3 * 1 * 9 * 5 = 945\\n\\n### Step 5: Check the divisibility of the product\\n- 945 is divisible by 5 (since the last digit is 5).\\n- 945 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of the digits is 18, which is divisible by 3).\\n- 945 is divisible by 15 (since it is divisible by both 3 and 5).\\n\\nNow let's check the divisibility of the product by the numbers mentioned in the answer options:\\n- 945 is **not divisible by 120** (as 945 \\u00f7 120 = 7.875, not an integer).\\n- 945 is **not divisible by 200** (as 945 \\u00f7 200 = 4.725, not an integer).\\n- 945 **is divisible by 100** (as 945 \\u00f7 100 = 9.45, not an integer).\\n- 945 is **not divisible by 175** (as 945 \\u00f7 175 = 5.4, not an integer).\\n- 945 is **not divisible by 125** (as 945 \\u00f7 125 = 7.56, not an integer).\\n\\n### Step 6: Correct answer\\nThe product of the different digits is a multiple of 125.\\n\\nAnswer: E\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
